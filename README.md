# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using structured housing data.

## Dataset
The project uses the California Housing dataset, which contains features such as median income, house age, number of rooms, population, and geographical information.

## Approach
- Data understanding and basic exploratory analysis
- Feature preprocessing
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model comparison with Decision Tree and Random Forest
- Evaluation using RMSE and R² score

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how different regression models perform on structured housing data and highlights the importance of model selection.

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
